		<h2>Reflections</h2>
		<p>For the Lesson 7 assignment, I chose to work on the alternative fuel station map project. My goal was to create an interactive
		web map displaying various types of alternative fuel stations across the United States. The map used the ArcGIS JavaScript API to
		integrate a FeatureLayer containing station data and represented numerous fuel types using easily discernable icons for the types 
		of fuel. Additionally, the map includes a state-based filter that zoomed to the selected state, offering a focused view of the stations.</p>
		<p>During the process, several challenges arose, starting with the integration of custom icons to represent different fuel types. 
		After reloading the map multiple times only to find the icons weren’t appearing in the map, I did some trouble shooting and reverted
		to a simple marker for the fuel stations. When the only marker that would come through on the map was the “other” category I knew the 
		values didn’t match the Fuel_Type field. Using the browser console's debugging tools helped identify these mismatches, allowing for 
		necessary updates to the renderer definitions to ensure that the symbols were displayed correctly.</p>
		<p>My original strategy of using my personal website on Infinityfree to host the image files wouldn’t work due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
		policy errors prevented the icons from loading correctly. To overcome this issue, I decided to host the icons locally within the GitHub repository. 
		This adjustment was successful, but only after exploring and addressing multiple potential problems, including path references and file accessibility.</p>
		<p>Reflecting on the experience, several valuable lessons were learned. First, proper file hosting and referencing are crucial, especially when dealing
		with web-based resources. Using GitHub Pages for hosting offered an accessible way to serve both the HTML file and image resources, avoiding the CORS 
		policy restrictions encountered earlier. Additionally, this project underscored the importance of using debugging tools to quickly identify and resolve
		data-related issues.</p>
		<p>In future projects, the experience gained here can be applied in several ways. When working with web maps, ensuring that all external resources are 
		correctly hosted and referenced is key to smooth functionality. Also, the hands-on practice with the ArcGIS JavaScript API and troubleshooting techniques
		will be directly applicable to similar web mapping projects. Overall, this project was a valuable exercise in problem-solving, technical implementation, 
		and resource management, which will undoubtedly help future GIS and web development tasks.</p>
